## Problem Statement 34

# Write a program which prompts the user to type an affirmation of your
#  choice (we'll use "I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.")
#  until they type it correctly. Sometimes, especially in the midst of such 
# uncertain times, we just need to be reminded that we are resilient, capable,
#  and strong; this little Python program may be able to help!

AFFIRMATION : str = "I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to."

def main():
    print("Please type the following affirmation: " + AFFIRMATION)

    user_feedback = input()  # Get user's input
    while user_feedback != AFFIRMATION:  # While the user's input isn't the affirmation
        # Tell the user that they did not type the affirmation correctly
        print("That was not the affirmation.")

        # Ask the user to type the affirmation again!
        print("Please type the following affirmation: " + AFFIRMATION)
        user_feedback = input()

    print("That's right! :)")


# There is no need to edit code beyond this point
